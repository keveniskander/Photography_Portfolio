<p>We drove through the somewhat Latin, mostly Slavic mountains of Romania to find ourselves faced with this majestic grizzly resolve. “Ursus”
             is their name, and coincidentally the name of their beer. While we complained about the poor visibility and slippery roads, these boorish
              brown-coated elegant killers sat soaked in dewdrops, sluggishly picking at berries. It drove me mad with envy.

            <br/>A warm Italian embrace amidst the cold mountains of Brashov. True love knows no bounds, and somehow these two find themselves standing face to
            face on the old cobblestone. Now that’s amore!

            <br/>Somewhere amidst this wildscape is a mountain goat. Or maybe a wild rodent creeping under the fog. As the mountains skip by my windshield, I'm left wondering if I
            every woke up this morning in Sibiu, or if this is some strange, illusive, subconscious float on Bâlea Lake.
